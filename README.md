Toy Robot Simulator

Tested on Unity 5.6.5 and 2018.3

Sample Robot Scripts are in [/Assets/Resources/RobotScripts](https://github.com/Alej-P/ToyRobotSimulator/tree/develop/Assets/Resources/RobotScripts/)

To run a Robot Script, with the GameManager gameObject selected on the Unity Hierarchy, drag the txt file from the RobotScripts folder to the 'Script File' field of the GameManager script.

After executing the whole script, GUI buttons would appear to control the robot interactively.

Unit tests are in [/Assets/Scripts/Editor/EditModeTests.cs](https://github.com/Alej-P/ToyRobotSimulator/blob/develop/Assets/Scripts/Editor/EditModeTests.cs)
